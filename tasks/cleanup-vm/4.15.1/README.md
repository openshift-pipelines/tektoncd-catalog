### Usage in different namespaces

You can use task to do actions in different namespace. To do that, tasks requires special permissions. Apply these RBAC objects and permissions and update accordingly task run object with correct serviceAccount:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
    name: cleanup-vm-task
rules:
-   apiGroups:
    - kubevirt.io
    resources:
    - virtualmachines
    - virtualmachineinstances
    verbs:
    - get
    - list
    - watch
    - delete
-   apiGroups:
    - subresources.kubevirt.io
    resources:
    - virtualmachines/start
    - virtualmachines/stop
    - virtualmachines/restart
    verbs:
    - update
